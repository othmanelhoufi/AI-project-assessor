# AI Project Assessment Tool

## 📋 Project Overview

The **AI Project Assessment Tool** is a sophisticated web application designed to help technology consultants make informed, fact-based decisions about AI project implementations. This tool combats the prevalent "generative AI solves everything" mentality by providing expert-level guidance on technology selection, project timelines, team requirements, and risk assessment.

### 🎯 Core Mission

- **Fact-based recommendations**: Move beyond AI hype to provide realistic technology assessments.
- **Expert guidance**: Deliver professional-grade insights on AI project feasibility.
- **Risk identification**: Highlight potential issues and knowledge gaps early in the planning process.
- **Resource planning**: Provide accurate estimates for team composition and project duration.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular, maintainable architecture with clear separation of concerns. The data layer has been refactored from a single JSON file into a structured `data` directory for improved scalability and maintainability.

## 📁 Detailed File Structure

### 📊 Data Layer (`data/`)

This new directory houses the core logic and content of the assessment, split into manageable files:
- **`categories.json`**: Defines the structure of the assessment, including sections, questions, and their options. It links to roles and technologies via IDs.
- **`rules.json`**: Contains all conditional rules that apply complex logic based on combinations of user answers.
- **`roles.json`**: A centralized dictionary of all possible team roles (e.g., "ML Engineer," "Data Architect"), making them reusable and easy to manage.
- **`technologies.json`**: A dedicated file for technology profiles and recommendations, referenced by IDs throughout the assessment.

### 🔧 Configuration Layer (`js/config/`)

- **`dom-selectors.js`**: Centralized DOM element selectors.
- **`constants.js`**: Application-wide constants, including the path to the `data/` directory.

### 🔌 Services Layer (`js/services/`)

- **`storage-service.js`**: Manages local storage for saved assessment history.
- **`data-service.js`**: **(Updated)** Now fetches and combines data from the multiple JSON files in the `data/` directory (`categories.json`, `rules.json`, etc.) to build the complete assessment model.
- **`assessment-service.js`**: **(Updated)** The core assessment engine. It processes user answers against the structured data loaded by `DataService` to generate results.

### 🎨 Components Layer (`js/components/`)

- **`wizard-controller.js`**: Orchestrates the main assessment flow.
- **`modal-manager.js`**: **(Updated)** Manages all modal dialogs, including the new assessment review pop-up with its programmatic "Export to PDF" functionality.
- **`progress-tracker.js`**: Tracks and displays user progress through the assessment sections.
- **`result-renderer.js`**: Formats and displays the final assessment results.

### 🎛 Managers Layer (`js/managers/`)

- **`state-manager.js`**: Manages the application's central state.
- **`navigation-manager.js`**: Handles page navigation.
- **`history-manager.js`**: Manages the list of saved assessments.

### 🚀 Application Entry Point (`main.js`)

- Initializes all modules and starts the application.

## 📊 Data Flow Architecture

The data flow has been updated to reflect the new modular structure.

### 1. **Data Loading**
/data/*.json → DataService → StateManager → UI Components*The `DataService` now fetches all JSON files from the `/data/` directory and assembles them into the complete assessment data model in the `StateManager`.*

### 2. **User Interaction**
User Input → WizardController → StateManager → UI Updates*(This flow remains the same.)*

### 3. **Assessment Generation**
User Answers → AssessmentService → Result Object → ResultRenderer → Display*The `AssessmentService` now references the structured data (roles, technologies, rules) from the state to generate a more accurate and detailed result.*

### 4. **Persistence**
Assessment Data → StorageService → localStorage → History Display*(This flow remains the same for user-saved assessments.)*

## 🎯 Key Features

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management Pattern
The application uses a centralized state management pattern with event-driven updates:

```javascript
// State updates trigger automatic UI refreshes
stateManager.setState('currentAnswers', newAnswers);
// Components automatically re-render based on state changes
```

### Modular Architecture Benefits
